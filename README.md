# square-root

Implement the square root algorithm explained on the lectures. The
algorithm runs modulo a prime number p > 2.
Run the implementation for a random argument a being a square root modulo p
for prime p of the form:
p = 2t · s + 1,
where s is an odd number greater than 299, and t ≥ 150. For checking print p
in the binary form. Check that the result returned by the algorithm is really a
square root from a mod p.
